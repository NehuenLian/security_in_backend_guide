# Backend Security: A Simple Theoretical Guide to Encryption, Hashing, and Authentication

*By [github.com/NehuenLian](https://github.com/NehuenLian)*

---

This guide is aimed at backend developers who are just starting out in the field or who, although already working in it, may have overlooked some security concepts.

The idea is for it to be a middle ground between technical and simpleâ€”that is, not an extremely technical document, but not so simple that the information becomes useless.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the reader is familiar with the following topics:

- HTTP protocol.
- Client-Server architecture.
- What an API is.
- Basic knowledge of system/software architecture (monoliths/microservices).

- Symmetric vs asymmetric encryption.
- Different security layers:
  - TLS encryption.
  - Token creation, digital signatures, and their validation.
  - Password hashing.
  - Encryption at rest.
- Flow for creating an account on a website or service.
- Flow for logging into a site.
